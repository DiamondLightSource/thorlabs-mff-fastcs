how it does it, and why people should use it.

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from thorlabs_mff_fastcs import __version__

print(f"Hello thorlabs_mff_fastcs {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m thorlabs_mff_fastcs --version
```
